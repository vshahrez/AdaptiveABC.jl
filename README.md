# AdaptiveABC

#### Installation

To install the package under Julia 0.7+ using `Pkg`, simply enter its interactive mode by pressing `]` in the Julia REPL and run
```
add https://github.com/vshahrez/AdaptiveABC.jl
```
After this, your Julia install will track AdaptiveABC's master branch. Installing updates works the same way as for registered packages, i.e. `update` in the Pkg interactive mode.
